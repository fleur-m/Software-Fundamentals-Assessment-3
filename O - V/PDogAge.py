# Program: calculate a dog's age in dog years.
# First two years = 10.5 human year per year
# After that = 4 years.

dogYear = 5

firstYears = 2 * 10.5
print(firstYears)
restOfYears = 3 * 4
print(restOfYears)
dogAge = firstYears + restOfYears
print(dogAge)

# Testing. Assertion 1:
'''
dogYear = 5
firstYears = 21
restOfYears = 12
dogAge = 33
